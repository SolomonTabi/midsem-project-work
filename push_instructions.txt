1) Create an empty repository on GitHub (no README, no .gitignore) and copy its HTTPS URL, e.g. https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git

2) Locally run these commands in this folder:

```powershell
# set the remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If Git prompts for credentials, use your GitHub username and a personal access token (PAT) as the password, or set up SSH keys and use the SSH repo URL.

If you want me to run the push from here, paste the repository URL and confirm I may run `git push` (you must provide auth or push from a session that has your credentials).
